# - Make this data agnostic so it could be converted into a module.
# - One axis will represent the reward/incentive/cost-saving measure.
# - The other will represent the service fee, commission, cost, etc.
# - Might also want to introduce an instrument for quantifying the 'sunk cost fallacy' angle or the "how
# far out will it be and time spent to refuel at a particular gas station, in relation to price saved."
