    -   collision/uninsured motorist increases during Oct-Dec for drunk drivers + holidays, then reduced coverage rest of year
    -   analyze coverage, premiums, inclusions, exclusions, and fine print between your health insurance, and auto insurance, to have a solid understanding of where exactly you have a lapse of coverage, and where you have overlaps that you could afford to cut costs.
    -   opendata datasets like vehicle accidents across the country, broken down into months, days, hours, and minutes if possible.
    -   Also run your vehicle through kbb, FB marketplace, and CL to have a average & range cost of your vehicle if you dump the current and buy another. This value will be handy for crunching numbers of how much deductible it'll be worth for you to have on coverages like collision and comprehensive, if you should even bother with such coverages.
        -   Ex: ded. will be $2,500 for chevy express 1500 cargo van, but I could just buy another same/similar for $3,500 off 2nd-hand market. Then especially after considering the ~$300/yr for premium costs, determine if it's even worth bothering with the whole insurance BS; not to mention the 'break even' threshold in roughly 3 years.


what's that one project that helps you write stuff down via llm and stt engine so you don't forget your thoughts mid-train/mid-chain. Want to say I found it in the awesome/self-hosted apps and not one of the *arr's or self-hosted for proxmox site.


Wallos
create an extension/plugin/feature, where on every subscription you add or edit, you'll have the option to include other plans or offerings from that provider. So for example, if you're given an offer where you could prepay your auto insurance 6 months in advance, you could add that in along with the % discount you get if you prepay instead of pay monthly. Same with other services like paying monthly for a VPN, Zoom, DocuSign, etc vs prepay 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, etc.
    -   an extension of that is to create somewhat of a 'virtual' budget bucket, for when you have surplus money. So with that surplus money you have, you could have Wallos 'list' all of those other offerings sorted by highest discounts at the top and going down on the discount %, and the first x rows (of offers) will be highlighted in green to indicate that the amount you have in surplus could cover that prepayment. Whereas the rest of the rows below that will be highlighted in a different color for you not having sufficient funds in surplus to afford those discounts; but they'll still be displayed here for your reference in case say you're $30 short of another/different offer, that may provide you with even greater savings/discounts, making it worthwhile to not spend that cash yet so you could add another $30 from like the following income check to have that bucket be able to purchase the better offer. An example/case study of this is how your discount might increase by how much more in advance you prepay, so if you have a 10% discount prepaying 3 months, but then a 6mo plan will be 25% off and it costs an extra $30, it'll make sense to go with the latter if my math is mathing correctly.
