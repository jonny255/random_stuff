Philosophical: Existentialism is a popular philosophy that encourages individuals to create their own purpose in life. While this theory doesn't rely on external evidence, its logic lies in the freedom and responsibility of each individual.\n2. Religious: Many religious theories propose specific moral or spiritual guidelines. The evidence for these theories often comes from sacred texts, personal experiences, or cultural traditions. However, the logic can be debated, as different religions may have conflicting beliefs.\n3. Scientific: The scientific theory focuses on evolution and survival. This theory is based on empirical evidence and logical reasoning, as it explains biological processes and behaviors."
