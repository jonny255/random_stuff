# random_stuff
Pretty random files in here... Really is for me to get more familiar with and learn CI/CD techniques and git in general. I did make it public in case anyone somehow stumbles upon this repo and is lucky enough to win the lottery but instead wasted that luck on finding the source code/solution they've been searching for.
